A basic Machine Learning project that uses the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices.
Models tested in this project are Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor and their results were compared.
The data was cleaned and the ML models were fitted indiviually. Cross-validation was also carried out to ensure proper functioning of the models.
